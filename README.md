## About

The EdiKit-ng project is a "modular platform for embedded systems learning"
which aims to use a modular and layered approach to build reusable and
extensible embedded systems to be used for education.

More information about the project can be found [here](https://code.google.com/p/edikit-ng/)

This repository holds all the schematics, printed circuit board (PCB),
Gerber files and [CadSoft EAGLE](http://www.cadsoftusa.com) components libraries for EdiKit boards.

## Contributing

We encourage students, electronics aficionados and hardware tinkerers
to design and build awesome EdiKit gadgets using the EKI-standard and
add new EKI interface boards to extend the supported EdiKit brains.
